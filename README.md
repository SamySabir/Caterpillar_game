Hey everyone, I present a caterpillar game that works just like the game Snake. This project was done in a Java Object-Oriented-Programming class.
The assignment 2 package contains every class, interface, and enumerations that build the different aspects of this caterpillar game. 
It basically works with stacks and queues implemented with doubly linked lists.
The package assignment2Tests has JUnit Tests that passes different kind of inputs (not done by me). My ActionQueue class doesn't support nested directions.
Run the game with CaterpillarGame.java under Game package.
This project was done in a Java Object-Oriented-Design class.
